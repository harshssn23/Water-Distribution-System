# Water-Distribution-System
The efficient management of water distribution is of paramount importance in ensuring sustainable development and the well-being of communities. This presents the development of an innovative application aimed at addressing the water distribution problem at the residential level. The proposed solution leverages advanced technologies and intelligent algorithms to optimize water usage, promote conservation, and enhance user experience.

To design an efficient water delivery system from a source node (over-head tank) to multiple nodes in a network of pipelines. By leveraging intelligent algorithms and advanced technologies, the proposed solution aims to minimize energy consumption, pressure losses, and construction costs while maximizing water flow and distribution effectiveness.

 The user-friendly interface will allow users to input network configurations and performance metrics, resulting in an optimized design plan with recommended pipeline routes and valve placements. This application has the potential to enhance water management practices, improve system performance, and contribute to sustainable development in residential communities.
